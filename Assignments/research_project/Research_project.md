Create a plan for how to obtain your ideal career.


Start with a goal that is defined by: 
- Position
- Industry 

Have a plan A and plan B. Ideally in the similar field. 

- Rationalize why you picked this plan A. 

See details for industry options in the markdown of the same folder.

Your next task is to define what skills make you successful in that role/industry.

You need to have 10 skills identified in total, 5 general skills, over arching themes, and 5 specific nuanced skills. 

For example a nuanced skill of a data engineer is being able to work with cloud storage infrastructure or needing to know how to use SQL to during ETL or ELT pipelines.

An example of a general skill for a data engineer might be closer to "being able to sync data from an api to a cloud application for injestion",

etc. 

Your current state diagram should be a matrix filling out the following:

### Task: Define Success Skills for Your Target Role

For each **role × industry combination** you're targeting (e.g., "ML Engineer at a High-Growth Tech Company" or "Research Scientist in Healthcare"), identify **10 skills** that make someone successful:

---

#### **5 General/Overarching Skills** *(Transferable, strategic)*
These are **meta-skills** that apply across companies/tools in that role:
- Example (Data Engineer): "Designing scalable data pipelines," "Communicating trade-offs to stakeholders"
- Example (ML Engineer): "Debugging model performance issues in production," "Collaborating with product teams to define success metrics"

---

#### **5 Specific/Nuanced Skills** *(Technical, tool/domain-specific)*
These are **hard skills** tied to specific technologies or workflows:
- Example (Data Engineer): "Writing optimized SQL for Snowflake," "Orchestrating pipelines with Airflow"
- Example (ML Engineer): "Fine-tuning LLMs with LoRA/QLoRA," "Deploying models on Kubernetes with Seldon/KServe"

---

#### **How to Identify These Skills:**
1. **Job Posting Analysis** - Review 5–10 postings and extract repeated requirements
2. **Read blog posts** - Medium blogs or linkedin posts
3. **LinkedIn Reconnaissance** - Check profiles of people 3–5 years into the role (what skills do they highlight?)
4. **Day-in-the-Life Content** - YouTube, LinkedIn blog posts, or subreddit wikis (r/datascience, r/MachineLearning, r/MLOps)

---

#### **Example Output (ML Engineer in High-Growth Tech):**

**General Skills:**
1. Building production ML systems that scales, covering data plumbing (ETL), and
2. Define model success metrics
3. Debugging latency/throughput issues in real-time inference
4. Stratigie to know which tools help with data-driven decisions under ambiguity (A/B testing, causal inference)
5. 

**Specific Skills:**
1. Training and deploying recommendation systems (collaborative filtering, two-tower models)
2. Fine-tuning LLMs (LoRA, PEFT, RLHF) and optimizing inference (vLLM, TensorRT)
3. Feature engineering at scale (Spark, Ray, Feast)
4. Containerizing applications using docker.
5. Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD for ML)


Be realistic, most of you aren't on the path for this ^ position or industry. 

Have a constraint that it must be attainable in the next 1 year. 

If it is not attainable in the next 1 year, you will lose marks .

How will you identify if it is attainable? 

Fill out this matrix given the skills mentioned above.

Skill Title, Priority of skill, I don't know it, I know how to implement it, I can define good testing criteria to ensure it's implemented correctly, I can connect these concepts to other important topics, I have discovered instances where it should be working but isn't (edge cases), I can explain incredibly complex implementations and intraciesi with ease to begineers
